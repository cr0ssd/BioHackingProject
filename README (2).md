# Biohacking project       

This project explores the intersection of biohacking, data science, and artificial intelligence to unlock deeper insights into personal health and performance. The core components are:

WHOOP Data Extraction: Leverages the WHOOP API to seamlessly extract daily metrics (heart rate variability, sleep data, recovery scores, etc.).

AI-Powered Analysis:  Utilizes the Google AI API to perform advanced data analysis, pattern recognition, and potentially generate predictions or recommendations tailored to optimize your biohacking strategies.
## Project goals

Establish a comprehensive data pipeline to streamline daily WHOOP metric collection.

Develop visualizations to track key biohacking indicators over time.

Explore correlations between WHOOP data and external factors (lifestyle habits, supplements, etc.).

Implement AI models for:

Anomaly detection in health metrics.
Forecasting potential performance or recovery trends.
Personalized recommendations based on individual data.
## Setup

Obtain WHOOP API Key:  Register as a WHOOP developer and obtain your API key.

Google AI Account: Create a Google Cloud Platform account and enable relevant AI APIs (e.g., Natural Language for insights from notes).

## Getting Started

1.- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

2.- Configure API keys in a .env file (ensure this is excluded from version control!).

3.- Run whoop_data_extractor.py to initiate data collection.

4.- Example Code Snippet (whoop_data_extractor.py)

import requests
import pandas as pd

WHOOP_API_KEY = 'your_whoop_api_key'

def get_whoop_data(start_date, end_date):
    # API endpoint setup, authentication, data extraction logic
    pass 

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = get_whoop_data('2024-02-20', '2024-02-24')  
    data.to_csv('data/raw_whoop_data.csv', index=False) 

## Collaboration and next steps

Feel free to suggest additional metrics, analyses, or AI-powered features you'd like to explore. Let's make this project a powerful tool for self-optimization!
